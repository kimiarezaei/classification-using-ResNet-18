In this repository we fine-tuned three popular deep learning architectures — Swin Transformer, ResNet18, and MobileNet — using their PyTorch implementations for seizure classification on stitched ECG spectrograms.

## Workflow
- Built a custom PyTorch dataset for ECG spectrogram classification.
- Fine-tuned Swin Transformer, ResNet18, and MobileNet on the dataset.
- Used Weights & Biases (wandb) for training visualization and benchmarking.
- Evaluated models on a completely unseen test dataset and plotted ROC–AUC curves to measure performance.
