This repository contains fine tuned pytorch models (Swintransformer, Resnet18 and Mobilenet) for seziure cassification using stitched ECG spectrograms.

---

## Workflow
- Built a custom PyTorch dataset for ECG spectrogram classification.
- Fine-tuned Swin Transformer, ResNet18, and MobileNet on the dataset.
- Used Weights & Biases (wandb) for training visualization and benchmarking.
- Evaluated models on a completely unseen test dataset and plotted ROCâ€“AUC curves to measure performance.
